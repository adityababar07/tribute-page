2. You can run tests from a toggle @ top left corner.

## Important Notice
> *You may add additional external JS and CSS as needed to complete the project, however the current external resource MUST remain in place for the tests to work. BABEL must also be left in place.*

>*Adding global style rules using the _ selector, or by adding rules to body {..} or html {..}, or to all elements within body or html, i.e. h1 {..}, has the potential to pollute the test suite's CSS.
> Try adding: _ { color: red }, for a quick example!*
